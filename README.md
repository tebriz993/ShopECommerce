I am working on an ECommerce website project using C# and ASP.NET MVC. The project is built with an N-Tier architecture, consisting of four layers: Business Logic, DataAccessLayer, Entity, and UI. The database used is MS SQL Server. To send data from the database to the view, I use DTOs. For services, I use ServiceExtension, and for mapping entities to DTOs, I use the AutoMapper tool. In some pages, where multiple models are needed, I use ViewModel to pass the list of models to the view. Additionally, there is a feature where any user message, when sent, is delivered to the admin panel along with the date and time, allowing the admin to see the message.
